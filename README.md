## ðŸ§¬Hybrid Comparative Genomics Pipeline

This repository provides an automated pipeline for comparative genomic analysis using a hybrid approach integrating:
- Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read DNA sequencing
- Illumina RNA-seq short-read transcriptome data

It streamlines analysis from raw signal to polished genome assemblies, including comparison and evaluation metrics.

## ðŸ’» Features
This pipeline includes scripts and configurations for:

-**Conversion**: fast5 â†’ pod5 using pod5tools

-**Basecalling**: performed using Dorado

-**Taxonomic analysis**: Kraken2

-**Quality Control**: Nanoplot, FastQC, Qualimap

-**Trimming & Filtering**: fastp, seqtk

-**De novo Assembly**: Flye, Canu, wtdbg2, NextDenovo, Hifiasm

**Polishing**:

- *DNA-based*: Racon, Medaka
- *RNA-based*: BWA, Pilon

- **Comparison & Evaluation**: QUAST, MUMmer, Minimap2, BLAST, GLSEARCH, BCFtools

## âœ… Requirements
- Bash (Linux environment)
- Conda or Miniconda installed
- Compatible bioinformatics tools installed and accessible in your $PATH (see environment setup below)

## ðŸ›  Installation and Setup
**1. Download environment YAML file**
This pipeline requires specific software environments. A ready-made Conda environment YAML file is provided:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/path/to/environment.yml
Alternatively, clone the repository and find the environment.yml file inside.

**2. Create the Conda environment**
Create the environment from the YAML file:
conda env create -f environment.yml
Activate the environment:
conda activate your_env_name
(Replace your_env_name with the name specified inside the YAML file, usually under name:.)


## ðŸš€ Running the Pipeline
Run the main orchestration script
The pipeline is controlled by a master bash script which runs all analysis steps and logs progress:

bash pipeline_ONT.sh

## ðŸ“Š Outputs
- Polished genome assemblies and their stats and reports;
- Alignment to reference genes and RBH summary Excel and TSV files;
- Nucleotidic and aminoacidic sequences from denovo assembly FASTA file;
- Alignment logs and summary reports.

## ðŸ“š Additional Notes
For reference genomes and annotation data, download FASTA and GFF3 files from NCBI:
- NCBI Genomes
- Use tools like wget or Entrez Direct for batch downloads.
- Visualize your results with genome browsers like IGV or Artemis.
